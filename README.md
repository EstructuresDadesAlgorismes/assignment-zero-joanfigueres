# Assignment 0
##What do I need to do?
Implement the method "quantSexe" of the given class `MainaderiaList.java`
Observe that this class implements the **interface** `` Mainaderia.java`

Eclipse provides a window where you can see a list of all `//TODO` comments. For Eclipse to show the list: Window --> Show View --> Tasks (do not confuse with Task List)

Make sure you pass all the provided *tests* (see next section) before you hand in your exercise. You can see tests a specification of the application you are ask to develop. You're encouraged to look at test's code. **Warning** bear in mind that passing the tests helps you to know that your code behaves as it is supposed to, but it is **NOT** a guaranty of having a good mark or even to have a mark grater that 5. Your mark will depend on your code stile and efficiency.     

It's **forbidden** to modify any of the tests. If any test code is modified the whole assignment will obtain a **zero mark**.

## What do I have?
In the current repository you'll find the *base code* that you need to complete. Your'll find the following package structure:
+ ex_02k: where you'll find the classes you need to complete
+ p0_material: where reside the `Criatura.java`class and `Mainaderia.java`interface.
+ test: where reside all JUnit tests. Your can run your tests selecting Run --> Run as --> JUnit test. It is forbidden to modify tests.
 
##How do I proceed? 
You are going to use GitHub in order to obtain the base code and to hand in your completed exercise. You'll need to perform the following steps:

1. To start, [**fork** the repository][forking] (to your GitHub account).
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment. It is mandatory to list all members of the group in the pull request comments.
